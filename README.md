# Snake-Game


The project aims to implement games using Linked Lists. A linear linked list is 
like a clothes line on which the data structures hang sequentially. A head 
pointer addresses the first element of the list, and each element points at a 
successive element, with the last element having a link value NULL.
Based on the number of link parts, the linked lists may be singly linked lists or 
doubly linked lists. The linked list in which there is a data part and an address 
part is called a singly linked list and list having a data pert and two address 
parts is called a doubly linked list.
The main operations I can do on a linked list are insertion, deletion and 
display the contents of the list
